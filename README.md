AWS Resource Usage Report

Aim: This project aims at tracking the AWS resource usage as and when and as frequently as required. 
To reduce the manual efforts that make this job tedious, we aim at automating the script and setting the alarm/timer/reminder to get the report on mail.

Description:

We get to track various AWS resouces in a user's account such as AWS EC2, AWS S3, AWS IAM users and many more and generate the report as and when we require.
Shell scripting offers users to connect to AWS through AWS CLI and then schedule report mailing using 'crontab'.
